# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweet Classification

## Overview:
In this project, we have to predict whether a particular tweet, of which the text (occasionally the keyword and the location as well) is provided, indicates a  "Disaster" or "Non Disaster".
These categories typically correspond to whether a tweet is about a real-world disaster (such as a hurricane, earthquake, or fire) or about a non-disastrous event or topic.

## Part-1 Data Exploration and Preparation
â€¢ In this task, we have done exploration of datasets and the visualization of dataset in different ways such as histogram or bar plots and we analyze the frequency of keywords.

We consider a number of text normalization processes, namely conversion to lowercase, removal of whitespaces, removal of punctuations, removal of unicode characters (including HTML tags, emojis, and URLs starting with http), removal of stop words, spelling correction, discardment of non-alphabetic words, and retention of relevant parts of speech.
