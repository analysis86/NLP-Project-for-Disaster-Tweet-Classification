# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweet Classification

## Overview:
In this project, we have to predict whether a particular tweet, of which the text (occasionally the keyword and the location as well) is provided, indicates a  "Disaster" or "Non Disaster".
These categories typically correspond to whether a tweet is about a real-world disaster (such as a hurricane, earthquake, or fire) or about a non-disastrous event or topic.
